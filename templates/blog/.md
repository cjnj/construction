Located on 42nd street in Midtown Manhattan, the structure features a stunning terra cotta façade manufactured by Boston Valley Terra Cotta.

The highly anticipated 1.75 million square foot tower, now the tallest office building in Midtown, takes up an entire block occupied by Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues. The construction of this supertall skyscraper was achieved through the collaboration of many parties to bring the tower to completion in 2020
